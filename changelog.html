    <p><i>2/16/2023</i>- ripping out a bunch of stuff behind the scenes to change the site layout.. making it more old-web-y, i guess?</p>
    <p><i>2/12/2023</i>- Working on the <a href="https://weirdring.netlify.app/">weirdcore webring</a> and added the buttons i made to my site. Removed marquee function to "last changed" on homepage.</p>
